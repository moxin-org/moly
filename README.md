# Moly: a Rust AI LLM client built atop [Robius](https://github.com/project-robius)

Moly is an AI LLM client written in Rust, and demonstrates the power of the [Makepad UI toolkit](https://github.com/makepad/makepad) and [Project Robius](https://github.com/project-robius), a framework for multi-platform application development in Rust.

> ⚠️ Moly is in beta. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/moxin-org/moly/issues/new) if you encounter bugs or unexpected results.

The following table shows which host systems can currently be used to build Moly for which target platforms.

## Building and Running

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Obtain the source code for this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/moxin-org/moly.git
```

#### Tip: use `moly-runner` for easy setup

> [!TIP]
> On all platforms, you can use our helper program to auto-setup WasmEdge for you and run any `cargo` command:
>
> ```sh
> cargo run -p moly-runner -- --install    ## finds or installs WasmEdge, then stops.
> cargo run -p moly-runner -- cargo build  ## builds Moly
> cargo run -p moly-runner -- cargo run    ## builds and runs Moly
> cargo run -p moly-runner -- cargo [your-command-here]
> ```

### macOS

Install the required WasmEdge WASM runtime (or use [`moly-runner`](#tip-use-moly-runner-for-easy-setup)):

```sh
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s -- --version=0.14.0

source $HOME/.wasmedge/env
```

Then use `cargo` to build and run Moly:

```sh
cd moly
cargo run --release
```

### Linux

Install the required WasmEdge WASM runtime (or use [`moly-runner`](#tip-use-moly-runner-for-easy-setup)):

```sh
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install_v2.sh | bash -s -- --version=0.14.0

source $HOME/.wasmedge/env
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your CPU does not support AVX512, then you should append the `--noavx` option onto the above command.
> If you use [`moly-runner`](#tip-use-moly-runner-for-easy-setup), it will handle this for you.

To build Moly on Linux, you must install the following dependencies:
`openssl`, `clang`/`libclang`, `binfmt`, `Xcursor`/`X11`, `asound`/`pulse`.
On a Debian-like Linux distro (e.g., Ubuntu), run the following:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config llvm clang libclang-dev binfmt-support libxcursor-dev libx11-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev
```

Then use `cargo` to build and run Moly:

```sh
cd moly
cargo run --release
```

## Windows (Windows 10, Windows 11 or higher)

1.  Download and install the LLVM v17.0.6 release for Windows: [Here is a direct link to LLVM-17.0.6-win64.exe](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-17.0.6/LLVM-17.0.6-win64.exe), 333MB in size.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the setup procedure, make sure to select `Add LLVM to the system PATH for all users` or `for the current user`.

2. Restart your PC, or log out and log back in, which allows the LLVM path to be properly

   - Alternatively you can add the LLVM path `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin` to your system PATH.

3. Use `moly-runner` to auto-setup WasmEdge and then build & run Moly:

```sh
cargo run -p moly-runner -- cargo run --release  ## `--release` is optional
```

---

## Packaging Moly for Distribution

> Note: we already have [pre-built releases of Moly](https://github.com/moxin-org/moly/releases) available for download.

Install `cargo-packager`:

```sh
rustup update stable  ## Rust version 1.79 or higher is required
cargo +stable install --force --locked cargo-packager
```

For posterity, these instructions have been tested on `cargo-packager` version 0.10.1, which requires Rust v1.79.

### Packaging for Linux

On a Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu), you can generate a `.deb` Debian package, an AppImage, and a pacman installation package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only generate a `.deb` Debian package on a Debian-based Linux distribution, as `dpkg` is needed.

> [!NOTE]
> The `pacman` package has not yet been tested.

Ensure you are in the root `moly` directory, and then you can use `cargo packager` to generate all three package types at once:

```sh
cargo packager --release --verbose   ## --verbose is optional
```

To install the Moly app from the `.deb`package on a Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu), run:

```sh
cd dist/
sudo apt install ./moly_0.1.0_amd64.deb  ## The "./" part is required
```

We recommend using `apt install` to install the `.deb` file instead of `dpkg -i`, because `apt` will auto-install all of Moly's required dependencies, whereas `dpkg` will require you to install them manually.

To run the AppImage bundle, simply set the file as executable and then run it:

```sh
cd dist/
chmod +x moly_0.1.0_x86_64.AppImage
./moly_0.1.0_x86_64.AppImage
```

### Packaging for Windows

This can only be run on an actual Windows machine, due to platform restrictions.

First, [follow the above instructions for building on Windows](#windows-windows-10-windows-11-or-higher).

Ensure you are in the root `moly` directory, and then you can use `cargo packager` to generate a `setup.exe` file using NSIS:

```sh
cargo run -p moly-runner -- cargo packager --release --formats nsis --verbose   ## --verbose is optional
```

After the command completes, you should see a Windows installer called `moly_0.1.0_x64-setup` in the `dist/` directory.
Double-click that file to install Moly on your machine, and then run it as you would a regular application.

### Packaging for macOS

This can only be run on an actual macOS machine, due to platform restrictions.

Ensure you are in the root `moly` directory, and then you can use `cargo packager` to generate an `.app` bundle and a `.dmg` disk image:

```sh
cargo packager --release --verbose   ## --verbose is optional
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will see a .dmg window pop up — please leave it alone, it will auto-close once the packaging procedure has completed.

> [!TIP]
> If you receive the following error:
>
> ```
> ERROR cargo_packager::cli: Error running create-dmg script: File exists (os error 17)
> ```
>
> then open Finder and unmount any Moly-related disk images, then try the above `cargo packager` command again.

> [!TIP]
> If you receive an error like so:
>
> ```
> Creating disk image...
> hdiutil: create failed - Operation not permitted
> could not access /Volumes/Moly/Moly.app - Operation not permitted
> ```
>
> then you need to grant "App Management" permissions to the app in which you ran the `cargo packager` command, e.g., Terminal, Visual Studio Code, etc.
> To do this, open `System Preferences` → `Privacy & Security` → `App Management`,
> and then click the toggle switch next to the relevant app to enable that permission.
> Then, try the above `cargo packager` command again.

After the command completes, you should see both the `Moly.app` and the `.dmg` in the `dist/` directory.
You can immediately double-click the `Moly.app` bundle to run it, or you can double-click the `.dmg` file to

> Note that the `.dmg` is what should be distributed for installation on other machines, not the `.app`.

If you'd like to modify the .dmg background, here is the [Google Drawings file used to generate the MacOS .dmg background image](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Uq13nAsCKFrl4s16HeLqpVfQ-vbF7v2Z8HFyqgeyrbE/edit?usp=sharing).

# Mofa

Currently, here in `dev` branch, Mofa is still in development. It's UI is hidden
and its backend is faked by default. This can be changed by setting some
provisional environment variables.

To run Moly with Mofa UI enabled but still using the fake backend use:

```sh
MOFA_FRONTEND=visible cargo run
```

To also enable the backend use:

```sh
MOFA_FRONTEND=visible MOFA_BACKEND=real cargo run
```

> Note: Enabling the backend requires running Dora and configuring its URL in
> Moly settings.
