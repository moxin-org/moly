  EXAMPLE: |
    Task: 如何增强混合大语言模型的能力？
    Answer:
      Improve Pre-training Methods:

      Knowledge Integration: During the pre-training process, integrate entity embeddings from knowledge bases, and combine entity linking loss with masked language modeling (MLM) loss to enhance the model's knowledge recall ability [2304.01597v1].
      Self-supervised Learning: Utilize a larger scale of unlabeled data, and improve the model's language understanding and generation capabilities through self-supervised learning [2304.01597v1].
