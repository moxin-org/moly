Moxin is a desktop app that lets you browse AI Large Language Models (LLMs),
download them, and run them locally to chat with the models.
Moxin uses the Makepad UI framework (https://github.com/makepad/makepad)
and Project Robius platform abstractions (https://github.com/project-robius),
and currently runs on major desktop platforms: macOS and Linux
(Windows support is coming soon).
Moxin uses the WasmEdge WASM runtime (https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge)
to locally run the AI models efficiently across varying hardware.

## Note: the `moxin-runner` crate binary is named `moxin`,
##       while the main `moxin` crate binary is named `_moxin_app`.
##       This is to avoid naming conflicts when packaging the binaries,
##       and also ensures that the `moxin-runner` binary is the "main" binary
##       that gets executed when the user runs "moxin" from the command line.

## The below command uses cargo-metadata to determine the path of the `makepad_widgets` crate on the host build system,
## and copies the `makepad-widgets/resources` directory to the `./dist/resources/makepad_widgets` directory.
## We also copy the Moxin project's `resources/` directory to the `./dist/resources/moxin` directory.
##
## This is necessary because the `cargo packager` command only supports defining resources at a known path
## (see the below `resources = [...]` block below),
## so we need to copy the resources to a known fixed (static) path before packaging,
## such that cargo-packager can locate them and include them in the final package.
##
## In addition, on macOS only, we must download the WasmEdge plugins in order to include them
## in the macOS app bundle. This is because macOS apps must include all dependencies in order to pass notarization.

## See the above paragraph comments for more info on how we create/populate the below `src` directories.
resources = [
    { src = "./dist/resources/makepad_widgets", target = "makepad_widgets" },
    { src = "./dist/resources/moxin", target = "moxin" },
]

## We then build the entire Moxin project and set the `MAKEPAD_PACKAGE_DIR` env var to the proper value.
## * For macOS app bundles, this should be set to `../Resources`.
##   This only works because the `moxin-runner` binary sets the current working directory
##   to the directory where the binary is located, which is `Moxin.app/Contents/MacOS/`.
##   (See the `run_moxin` function in `moxin-runner/src/main.rs` for more details.)
##   In a macOS app bundle, the resources directory is in `Moxin.app/Context/Resources/`,
##   so that's why we set `MAKEPAD_PACKAGE_DIR` to `../Resources` --- it must be relative to the binary's location,
##   which is up one parent directory.
## * For Debian `.deb` packages, this should be set to `/usr/lib/<main-binary-name>`,
##   which is currently `/usr/lib/moxin-runner`.
##   This is the directory in which `dpkg` copies app resource files to when installing the `.deb` package.
##   * On Linux, we also strip the binaries of unneeded content, as required for Debian packages.
##   * For Debian and Pacman (still a to-do!) packages, we also auto-generate the list of dependencies required by Moxin,
##     making sure to add `curl` since it is used by an invocation in `moxin-runner`.
