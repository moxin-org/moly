Moxin is a desktop GUI client that lets you browse AI Large Language Models (LLMs), download them,
and run them locally to chat with the models.
Moxin is built using the Makepad UI framework (https://github.com/makepad/makepad)
and Project Robius platform abstractions (https://github.com/project-robius),
and currently runs on all three major desktop platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Moxin uses the wasmedge WASM runtime to locally run the AI models.

## Note: the `moxin-runner` crate binary is named `moxin`,

##       This is to avoid naming conflicts when packaging the binaries,

## The below command uses cargo-metadata to determine the path of the `makepad_widgets` crate on the host build system,
## and copies the `makepad-widgets/resources` directory to the `./dist/resources/makepad_widgets` directory.
## We also copy the Moxin project's `resources/` directory to the `./dist/resources/moxin` directory.
##
## This is necessary because the `cargo packager` command only supports defining resources at a known path
## (see the below `resources = [...]` block below),
## so we need to copy the resources to a known fixed (static) path before packaging,
## such that cargo-packager can locate them and include them in the final package.
##
## In addition, on macOS only, we must download the WasmEdge plugins in order to include them
## in the macOS app bundle. This is because macOS apps must include all dependencies in order to pass notarization.

## We then build the entire Moxin project and set the `MAKEPAD_PACKAGE_DIR` env var to the proper value.
## * For macOS app bundles, this should be set to `../Resources`.
##   This only works because the `moxin-runner` binary sets the current working directory 
##   to the directory where the binary is located, which is `Moxin.app/Contents/MacOS/`.
##   (See the `run_moxin` function in `moxin-runner/src/main.rs` for more details.)
##   In a macOS app bundle, the resources directory is in `Moxin.app/Context/Resources/`,
##   so that's why we set `MAKEPAD_PACKAGE_DIR` to `../Resources` --- it must be relative to the binary's location,
##   which is up one parent directory.
## * For Debian `.deb` packages, this should be set to `/usr/lib/<main-binary-name>`,
##   which is currently `/usr/lib/moxin-runner`.
##   This is the directory in which `dpkg` copies app resource files to when installing the `.deb` package.
